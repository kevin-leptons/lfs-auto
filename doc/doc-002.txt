1. overview

    this document provide setup linux from scrapt flow. document build on
    linux from scratch manual. setup flow not only linux from scratch, it is
    also contains some work to prepare setup environemnt. see doc-001 for
    information about setup architecture

    section 2 specify target of this document. section 3 describe general
    operation in all of step. section 4 to section 11 describe setup step.
    section 12 show references


2. target

    - follow setup architecture in doc-001

    - follow instruction of linux from scrapt to setup gnu/linux system

3. general operations

    make sure that each step and child step is log to log file with
    informations

        - date time: when operation is execute

        - message: an message specify what is operation do

        - result: true on operation successfully, false on operation error

    depend on step, log file will be specify later. path of log file start
    from root directory of lfs-auto


4. setup host

    make sure that below packages is installed on host system

        - docker-engine: use to build, run container

        - util-linux: use create virtual disk as big file system

        - e2fsprogs: use to format virtual disk to ext4 format

    in case package is not installed on host system, install that package
    auto

    log file: log/process.log

5. setup container

    make sure that all package required to setup temporary package was
    installed inside docker by docker file. do not install package when entered
    docker, because each time start container, container will reset without
    packages installed
